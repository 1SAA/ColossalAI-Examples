## OPT and causal language modeling 

Fine-tuning (or training from scratch) the library models for language modeling on a text dataset for OPT... Models such as OPT are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling
(CLM) loss.

The following example fine-tunes Facebook OPT on WikiText-2. We're using the raw WikiText-2 (no tokens were replaced before
the tokenization). The loss here is that of causal language modeling.

This training script is adapted from the [HuggingFace Language Modelling examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling).

You can invoke training by using the prepared bash script

```bash
bash ./run_clm.sh
```

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This takes about half an hour to train on a single K80 GPU and about one minute for the evaluation to run. It reaches
a score of ~20 perplexity once fine-tuned on the dataset.

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This uses the built in HuggingFace `Trainer` for training. If you want to use a custom training loop, you can utilize or adapt the `run_clm_no_trainer.py` script. Take a look at the script for a list of supported arguments. An example is shown below:

```bash
python run_clm_no_trainer.py \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```
